SnipEditor_MavenBuild
=====================
Working maven build and most of the JFace grammar. <br>
The update site can be found here[1]. In order to use, please follow the instructions provided<br>
in the update site readme file. It does not work directly from eclipse IDE(yet).<br>  
This build supports syntax for class declarations, method declarations, attribute declarations and assignments and <br>
basic operations. I also offers code completion and proposals for java and declared methods.<br>
 Examples can be found in the update site repository.<br>
In order to open the projects in eclipse, simply clone the repo on the local computer and import the projects<br>
in eclipse. You will also need to generate the language artifacts.
<br>
<br>

In order to build this, follow the steps:<br>
 (1)clone the repo to the local computer<br>
 (2)open the command line<br>
 (4)run the command mvn clean install.<br>
